Cards were made by PenitentKnight on reddit except the clue token and emblem made (very quickly) by myself.

Once downloaded go onto cocktrice go to 'Card Database'> Add Custom sets/cards then open Danganronpa Cards.xml. This will add the cards to cocktrice.
Everyone who wants to see the cards art and what it does must do this even if they are not playing the deck, or they will only see the names of the cards and no text or art.

Then go to deck editor > Load deck and open Hope's Peak Commander.cod to add the deck list on cocktrice.
